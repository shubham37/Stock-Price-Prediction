# Stock-Price-Prediction

  The Objective of this Project is to Evaluate Different Machine Learning Algorithms based on their predictions of stock prices .Stock price prediction is a method in which the future value of the company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange are determined. The Successful prediction of stockâ€™s future could yield significant profit.

  Different techniques were used for training models namely Supervised Regression, Random Forest ,Support Vector Machine and K Nearest Neighbor. We compare all three models on optimization algorithms such as  root mean square error.

# Conclusion


The Stock Price Prediction project was carried out to analyze  different machine learning techniques for stock price prediction  . We trained four different models on this data SVM, KNN, Linear regression and Random Forest. We then used these models to predict accuracy and calculated root mean square error from the actual stock Price. From observation of this project, we found out that Random Forest is a better method for Stock Price Prediction.
